# Jeylabs code reviews(C#)


## Goal

* Build a small web site in C#.
* Use any front end  library you want. 

### It must:

* Fetch and display a list of people via a network request
* Clicking a person should show more details
* Allow adding a person
* Allow editing the details
* Allow delete of a person

### It can:

* Store the result in a database (but not essential)
* Allow additional functionality not described here



### Other implementations:

* Membership Login System(include validation for user input)
* Connect to SQL database and store the result
* Additional member list page include all infomation about membership
<br/>

# Default Login info
* Username: admin
* Password: admin
<br/>

To manage this login system, some kind of authorization is required. As a result, I implement a login system using Username and Password data within SQL database. Matching username and password will give user authorization to enter the main control page to check and manage the data within SQL database.
<br/>

Since this is the first time I use VS build in SQL database. I watched some video and online resource to learn database connecting, loading, altering method.
